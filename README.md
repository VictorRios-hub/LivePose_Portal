# LivePose Portal

## Democratize immersive arts by having participants train both themselves and the deep-learning models for camera-based group interactivity in a portal before entering the show !

Deep learning techniques are often developed by visible majorities, like us, this can lead to recognition bias against those with appearances that may “diverge” from the visible majority, like people with darker skin tones.

Overcoming bias in technology is our responsibility as builders. It’s everyone’s responsibility.

We build technologies to enable people to interact with and within immersive arts
